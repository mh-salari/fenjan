      "Summary of PhD Program:\n",
      "Against the background of global challenges such as climate change and the growing world population, Forschungszentrum Jülich is conducting research with a view to optimizing yields, improving soil and water conservation, and minimizing the impact of climate change. This requires a detailed understanding of the flow and transport processes in soils, as well as the dynamic development of root growth. One of several established measurement methods for such applications in geophysics is georadar. \n",
      "Georadar operates in the frequency range from about 200 to 2000 MHz. The coupling into the ground is done with antennas and is therefore non-invasive. In this way, characteristic soil properties such as electrical and dielectric conductivity can be determined. In cooperation with the Institute of Agrosphere (IBG-3), a novel measurement system with a large number of antennas is being developed, which enables high-resolution three-dimensional tomography of undisturbed soil columns.\n",
